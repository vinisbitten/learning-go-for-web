## Disclaimer

- This is a simple project to learn how to use Go for web development. It is not meant to be used in production.
- When creating a project you should not put everything in one file. For example use a different file for the database connection and another one for the routes.
- Run each ecample in its own folder. For example, if you want to run example 2, you should run it from the folder `examples/02-templates/` and not from the root folder of the project.
